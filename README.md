# ✨ Personal Blog — Built with Next.js

Welcome to my blog! This project is a modern, fast, and SEO-friendly blog built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), fully styled and deployed using GitHub Pages.  
It’s a **personal pet project** designed to level up my frontend skills while learning how to create highly-optimized, production-ready sites.
