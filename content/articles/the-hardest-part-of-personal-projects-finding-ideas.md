Have you tried to find ideas? I am sure that your answer is "Yes." Now I'm preparing for my future job in the IT sphere. I don't know who I am going to be, but I must do personal projects anyway. And you probably think that the hardest part is developing the project, but I don't think so. The hardest part for me is finding ideas that will light a fire in my eyes. I have two good personal projects now: Onda—personal planner—and Cerk—this blog. And I am proud of these two projects just because I really use them, and that is the main thing that I seek in ideas. A lot of people do online shops, todo apps, or something like that, and they forget about them right after ending the development. I don't judge them and don't think that it's bad if they really like that, but when I develop something just for a checkmark, I feel like I'm throwing my time in the trash.

I want to elaborate on Onda's example. I was using Notion database's table view as my personal life tracker for 8 months. I was feeling that I wanted to have more customization and decided to develop my own app. I was 99% sure that I was going to use that, and I was right. And now for almost 5 months I've been developing the project and using it every day, and it feels awesome. The key plus of a pet project that you use is that you have infinite motivation and ideas for developing your project. I hate and like that I must rebuild trash code that I built using AI for MVP, but I feel that it's really improving my skills and understanding of how to build a project in a way that I can maintain it, and I'm starting to understand things that I couldn't understand when I built the project and forgot about it forever. But the belief has a very negative effect on idea finding. It makes the process mentally exhausting. I just write ideas in my list and can't find an idea in which I will be sure at least 80%.

And I feel that it is a very big problem for me and probably for a lot of other people in the world. I even wanted to build SaaS to fix that problem. The main idea was that I would give advanced prompts to AI, and it would give me better ideas that would be more interesting than standard CRUD apps, but I used Ollama's free API, and it was giving me 10 of the same ideas even If my prompt said that the ideas should be completely different, it could give me 10 ideas that use QR codes. But now I have OpenAI's API and maybe will try to test the idea with it. 

And you will say that I should find my problems and fix them, but yeah, probably you are right... I just read all I wrote here and understand that everything sounds so strange, and I should stop it now. But I will post it anyway.

the end.
